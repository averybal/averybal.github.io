title: Why Make a Blog? (11/14/2020)
---

It's hard for me to pin down any exact reason other than just "I wanted to," but that's not the most useful answer in the world. I thought about it while setting up this website, and I settled on four main reasons:

1. Surprisingly, I do like writing in a non-graded context. Making content - of any kind - is quite a bit more fun than merely consuming it, so I decided on this as the outlet for that content-creating itch I've been having for the past few months. 
     - Yes, I could have made some educational YouTube channel or something (my second choice), but a) writing _and_ filming is infinitely more time consuming than just writing, and b) the view count being so available to me would mess with my head. I don't have any analytics set up here, so I can pretend the number of people reading this is **exactly** the number I want it to be. 
2. I have many thoughts that fall in this zone between "Interesting enough to write down somewhere" and  "Not interesting enough to bother my friends with." I guess that's what Twitter is for, but I'm looking for something a bit longer form. This blog seems like a great place to put those thoughts that would otherwise be lost. 
3. I could never make myself journal consistently - which is something I've always wanted to do - so maybe switching to a platform that's semi-kinda-public will hold me accountable
4. I'm aiming to improve my attention span, and hopefully, something like this that's low-risk, low(ish)-effort, enjoyable, and quasi-productive will help me stop looking at my phone every five minutes and focus on one thing at a time.

With that, let's move on to some commonly asked questions about blogs, and hopefully, I can clear some things up:

## What's This Blog Going to be About?
Great question! The short answer is: whatever I think is interesting. I have this idea of this blog centering around questions - questions I hear on the news, or that people ask me, or that I think of during walks, etc. - and me working towards an answer over the course of a post. Of course, not everything is going to be very deep or philosophical (I plan on doing quite a bit of movie reviews in the form of "What Did You Think of [x]"), but at the very least, I hope you leave here with a "Huh, that was interesting." Also, I'm much better at specific prompts than vague ones, so this whole "Questions" theme will help focus my thought process a bit. 

## How Long is Each Post Going to Be?
The whole point of doing this is to have a longer-form platform, so I'm going to try to have a self-imposed minimum of 500 words - around the length of a one-page single-spaced typed document. Maybe some will be longer if they're a bit more research-intensive, and others will be shorter if there's not much to talk about, but it's a good rule of thumb. Fun Fact: Apparently, that will take you around four minutes to read, according to <https://wordstotime.com/>

## How Often Will You Post?
Look, the last thing I want to do is add yet _another_ deadline to my already quite hectic schedule, but one of the reasons for me doing this is to be accountable with my writing. I've settled on a compromise where I *say* I'm going to post twice a month, but I *actually* post once a month. Kind of like how you tell yourself you have to be at an 8:00 event at 7:00 to motivate you to go a bit faster. 

## How Formal/Polished is This Going to Be?
This is technically a public space where anyone (including future employers) can look, so I suppose I should keep it relatively above-board. On the other hand, I have a lot of non-professional thoughts intertwined with the professional, and I'm not going to stop myself from writing about things the way I see them because I'm scared some middle-manager  doesn't like me saying "Fuck." Bottom line, anyone who knows me knows my thoughts meander through the weirdest tangents, and while not all those tangents are dinner-table material, at least they'll be compelling. Just... imagine how college students usually talk. As for the writing standard, I want to keep this stream-of-conscious-y, so I don't plan on writing a rough draft and then a final draft or anything like that. I'll write what comes to mind, and I'll change some sentence structures if they become unclear, replace a word if it becomes repetitive, or rearrange some paragraphs if I like the flow better. I'm not going to worry about whether I split an infinitive or whatever. If I make a factual statement, I will try my best to ensure it is correct and cite reputable sources backing up said statement.  

## What is the End Goal Here?
I guess this is a "Bad Answer," but nothing. I want to do something I've never done before (create content) in a way that simultaneously relaxes and stimulates me. Trying to keep this going for more than two posts is goal enough. 

## Are you Sure you have Time for This?
No. 

With the questions answered, my first "real" post will be about my thoughts/predictions for 2021, so hopefully, you look forward to that! Peace.
